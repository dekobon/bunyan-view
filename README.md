# Bunyan Viewer

This project is a rewrite of the [node-bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/) bunyan format 
[log viewer CLI tool](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/blob/master/bin/bunyan) done in Rust. 
This is my first Rust project, so expectations should be set accordingly.

## Divergences

We aim to provide output that is as close as possible to the [node-bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/)
viewer with a few intentional [divergences](DIVERGENCES.md).
